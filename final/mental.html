                    <ol>
                        <li>Set a powerful intention before your workout</li>
                        <li>Use short-term goals to stay focused</li>

                    <p>
                        Fitness isn't just about lifting weights or running miles—it's about pushing through the days you don't feel like showing up. It's the <mark>mental reps</mark> that build your discipline. Your mind can either be your biggest barrier or your strongest ally, especially at <time datetime="06:00">6:00 AM</time> when the bed feels warmer than your goals.
                    </p>                    
                    <p>
                        Everyone hits mental walls. The key is to recognize them and develop the tools to climb over. Set yourself up for success by identifying what motivates you. Whether it's a playlist, a mantra, or a goal, make it part of your ritual.

                        <li>Visualize completing your workout</li>
                        <li>Break sessions into smaller segments</li>
                        <li>Breathe intentionally during hard moments</li>
                        <li>Remind yourself why you started</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Mental fatigue can hit harder than physical exhaustion. When it does, shift your focus inward. Train your mind the same way you train your body—through consistent challenge and recovery. Journaling your thoughts after each session can reveal patterns and breakthroughs.

                        The strongest athletes aren't always the ones who lift the most—they're the ones who keep showing up. Building resilience means sticking to your plan even when the spark is gone. That's when real growth happens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Create structure for your mindset, just like your workout plan. Morning affirmations, scheduled check-ins, or even <time datetime="20:30">8:30 PM</time> reflections can anchor your progress. Stay grounded in your goals.

                            That moment when you want to quit? That's the edge of growth. Mental blocks often show up when progress slows, but pushing through them defines your future success. Train your brain to see challenge as opportunity.

                            When the mental game gets tough, remember what you've already accomplished. Use your workout plan to fuel your mindset. Show up for yourself. Every time you win the mental battle, you become stronger in every area of life. Confidence is built through effort, not ease.
