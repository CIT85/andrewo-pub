            <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                This site shares a lot of great information about eating well, exercising with enjoyment and exploring
                various ways to accomplish workout goals. When it comes to eating healthy, it is important to know that
                taste doesn't have to be sacrificed. Activities are opportunities to improve physically, mentally, and
                even socially.</p>
            <p>
                ThriveCircle is for the everyday person who is in the grind of life. Where it seems that as soon as one
                responsibility ends, another one begins. The world has trained us to be non-stop consumers as well, that
                our individual long term health has taken a backseat to everything else. This site is for that person
                who wants to change their consumption to something healthier and happier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our inspiration comes from a variety of powerful sources. <em>Atomic Habits</em> by James Clear has been
                instrumental in helping us understand how habits form and how to build better ones. David Goggins' <em>Can't
                Hurt Me</em> shatters excuses and challenges us to push beyond our limits. Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman,
                Ph.D., through his Huberman Lab podcast, provides science-backed insights into the powerful connection
                between the brain and body - and how that relationship shapes every aspect of our lives.

            <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <p>
                As ThriveCircle continues to grow, we plan to introduce new features like personalized fitness trackers with unlockable rewards, interactive progress dashboards, and user-based video tutorials for meals and workouts. We'd also like to implement the use of JavaScript for dynamic content updates. In the future, we hope to implement accessibility tools and consider adding a blog section where users can share success stories, tips, and motivation to inspire others on their health journey.
